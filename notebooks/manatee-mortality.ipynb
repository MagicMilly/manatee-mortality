    "## Probable Causes of Death\n",
    "### Official Categories & Descriptions\n",
    "* __Watercraft__ - Watercraft-related mortality. Death may result from propeller wounds, impact, crushing, or any combination of the three.\n",
    "* __Crush / Drowned in Flood Gate or Canal Lock__ - Manatees killed by crushing or asphyxiation in flood gates and canal locks.\n",
    "* __Other Human Related__ - Manatee deaths caused by vandalism, poaching, entrapment in pipes and culverts, complications due to entanglement in ropes, lines, and nets, or ingestion of fishing gear or debris.\n",
    "* __Perinatal__ - Manatees less than or equal to 150 cm (5 feet) in total length which were not determined to have died due to human-related causes.\n",
    "* __Cold Stress__ - Manatees which die as a result of exposure to acute or prolonged cold weather. Animals are usually emaciated and in a general state of malnutrition. (Combined with \"Other Natural\" in some printouts.)\n",
    "* __Other Natural__ - Manatee deaths resulting from infectious and non-infectious diseases, birth complications, natural accidents, and natural catastrophes (such as red tide blooms).\n",
    "* __Undetermined: Too Decomposed__ - Manatee deaths in which the cause of death could not be determined due to an advanced stage of decomposition.\n",
    "* __Undetermined: Other__ - Manatee deaths in which the carcass was in good condition (fresh or moderately decomposed), but necropsy findings were inconclusive. (Combined with \"Undetermined\" in some printouts.)\n",
    "* __Verified / Not Recovered__ - Manatee deaths that were reported and verified, but a complete necropsy was not performed. (Combined with \"Undetermined\" in some printouts.)"
